## 🚧 How It Works

1. **Add contact** via modal (name + phone)
2. Contact added to custom `LinkedList`
3. Dropdown auto-populates with all contacts
4. Select a contact and type a message
5. Click **Send** → Opens WhatsApp with pre-filled message 🎯

## 🔐 Security Note

* This app **doesn't store** contacts in a backend — it all happens client-side.
* All data is lost on refresh (localStorage integration coming soon!)
